# Workflow

To create a common APIManager class for managing multiple SOAP API calls, you can follow a modular approach. Here's a basic outline of how you can structure your APIManager class:
- Create a Singleton Class: Make APIManager a singleton so that you have a single instance throughout your application.
- Define a Method to Make SOAP Requests: Create a method in APIManager to handle SOAP requests. This method should take parameters such as the SOAP message, endpoint URL, HTTP method, headers, etc.
- Handle Responses: Implement callback mechanisms or closures to handle responses from the server. These closures should be flexible enough to handle various types of responses.
- Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to handle network errors, parsing errors, etc.
- Additional Features: You can add features like request logging, caching, retry mechanisms, etc., based on your requirements.
- With this APIManager class in place, you can now call SOAP APIs from anywhere in your codebase by using APIManager.shared.makeSOAPRequest(soapMessage:endpoint:completion:) method.


To use the APIManager class for making SOAP API calls, you would follow these steps:
1. Create your SOAP request message.
2. Specify the endpoint URL for the SOAP service.
3. Use the makeSOAPRequest method of the APIManager class to send the SOAP request.
4. Handle the response in the completion handler

In this example:
- Replace the soapMessage with your actual SOAP request message.
- Replace the endpointURL with the URL of your SOAP service.
- The makeSOAPRequest method is called with the SOAP message and endpoint URL.
- In the completion handler, you handle the response or error accordingly. If the response is successful, you can parse the XML response if needed. If there's an error, you handle it appropriately.
